# Methodology

The use of standardized data analysis pipelines is essential for ensuring the accuracy and
reproducibility of multi-parametric single-cell assays.

We have therefore developed a set of computational routines for designing and performing drug dose-response assays using the Dye Drop method. These routines are integrated with scripts we
previously developed for computing GR metrics63 in a single tool box. Dye Drop dose-response analysis
features a series of “flags” that alert users when experimental design criteria and results such as the
number of controls, the dose range, and the accuracy of curve fitting are suboptimal.
