# Quick start

1. Install the python analysis package from github
2. cd Into the example folder as show below
    ```
    cd DrugResponse/python/cell_cycle_gating/examples/  
    
3. Open the jupyter notebook `DDR_example.ipynb` on your machine and execute the steps in the notebook. 
    Alternatively, you can use your preffered python environment i.e sypder or ipython and follow the steps shown in the example page.
4. The code takes roughly 2-4 minutes to run. Two output fles will be generated upon successful completion of you run
     - EX_01[78956].csv  # A table containing rows corresponding to wells in the 96 well plate. Each well (row) will contain well-level summary of number of live/dead cells and fraction of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.
     - EX_01[78956].pdf # The script saves a pdf showing multiple figures; one for each well. Each figure shows the gating on each DNA v EDU scatter plot for review.
